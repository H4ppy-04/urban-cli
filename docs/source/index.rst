About Urban
===========

Urban was developed as a small portfolio side project while I was working at university.
The core features were developed in the span of :math:`1\frac{3}{4}` weeks, in which I spent developing and refining this project to be as optimized and bug-free as possible.

To this day, it is still being developed, and it will be developed for the foreseeable future.

This project follows a 'modified' system of `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_ in which components are representative of deprecation and major updates.
