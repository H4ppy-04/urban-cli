About Urban
===========

.. IMPORTANT::
   Urban is undergoing a comprehensive rework due to the fact that everything is currently being developed within a single monolithic file. As part of this process, the development on the main branch has been temporarily paused while work continues on other branches. If you'd like to learn more details about the rework, please refer to `rework <rework.html>`_.

Urban was developed as a small portfolio side project while I was working at university.
The core features were developed in the span of :math:`1\frac{3}{4}` weeks, in which I spent developing and refining this project to be as optimized and bug-free as possible.

To this day, it is still being developed, and it will be developed for the foreseeable future.

This project follows a 'modified' system of `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_ in which components are representative of deprecation and major updates.
