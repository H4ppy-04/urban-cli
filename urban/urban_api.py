:File: urban_api.py

The API contains centralized interactions with urban-cli.
It's responsible for the following functions.

Sending requests
----------------
Requests that need to be sent to a remote source will be done so through
functions declared in this file. Most of which, will be using custom
exception classes as normal exceptions will not suit this specific use case.

Processing responses
--------------------
Responses that received using the requests library are processed and checked.
Edge cases such as 404 errors work differently in this application, as one
would signify that a word has not been defined as oppose to a missing page.

Integration
-----------
Functions that are defined in the various files around the codebase are managed
within the API file. This file serves as a central point from which functions are
accessed.
