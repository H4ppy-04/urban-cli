The beautifulsoup library helps beautifully ✨ with this. It parses html data in a way that can be 
read and manipulated very easily.

I/O handling
------------
The argparse library can be thought of as boilerplate level code in addition to a few extra classes 
that greatly help building a command line interface. It removes most of the argument logic and lets the
developer focus on what's important. Argparse is used in this file for showing and receiving data.
